Counterparts to R string manipulation functions that account for the
effects of ANSI text formatting control sequences.

## Formatting Strings with Control Sequences

Many terminals will recognize special sequences of characters in strings
and change display behavior as a result. For example, on my terminal the
sequences `"\033[3?m"` and `"\033[4?m"`, where `"?"` is a digit in 1-7,
change the foreground and background colors of text respectively: <!--
We tried to do everything using to_html, but github suppresses all html
-->

    fansi <- "\033[30m\033[41mF\033[42mA\033[43mN\033[44mS\033[45mI\033[m"

This type of sequence is called an ANSI CSI SGR control sequence. Most
\*nix terminals support them, and newer versions of Windows and Rstudio
consoles do too. You can check whether your display supports them by
running `term_cap_test()`.

Whether the `fansi` functions behave as expected depends on many
factors, including how your particular display handles Control
Sequences. See `?fansi` for details, particularly if you are getting
unexpected results.

## Manipulation of Formatted Strings

ANSI control characters and sequences (*Control Sequences* hereafter)
break the relationship between byte/character position in a string and
display position. For example, to extract the “ANS” part of our colored
“FANSI”, we would need to carefully compute the character positions:

With `fansi` we can select directly based on display position:

If you look closely you’ll notice that the text color for the `substr`
version is wrong as the naïve string extraction loses the
initial`"\033[37m"` that sets the foreground color. Additionally, the
color from the last letter bleeds out into the next line.

## `fansi` Functions

`fansi` provides counterparts to the following string functions:

-   `substr` (and `substr<-`)
-   `strsplit`
-   `strtrim`
-   `strwrap`
-   `nchar` / `nzchar`
-   `trimws`

These are drop-in replacements that behave (almost) identically to the
base counterparts, except for the *Control Sequence* awareness. There
are also utility functions such as `strip_ctl` to remove *Control
Sequences* and `has_ctl` to detect whether strings contain them.

Much of `fansi` is written in C so you should find performance of the
`fansi` functions to be slightly slower than the corresponding base
functions, with the exception that `strwrap_ctl` is much faster.
Operations involving `type = "width"` will be slower still. We have
prioritized convenience and safety over raw speed in the C code, but
unless your code is primarily engaged in string manipulation `fansi`
should be fast enough to avoid attention in benchmarking traces.

## Width Based Substrings

`fansi` also includes improved versions of some of those functions, such
as `substr2_ctl` which allows for width based substrings. To illustrate,
let’s create an emoji string made up of two wide characters:

    pizza.grin <- sprintf("\033[46m%s\033[m", strrep("\U1F355\U1F600", 10))

![](https://github.com/brodieG/fansi/raw/v1.0-rc/extra/images/pizza-grin.png)

And a colorful background made up of one wide characters:

    raw <- paste0("\033[45m", strrep("FANSI", 40))
    wrapped <- strwrap2_ctl(raw, 41, wrap.always=TRUE)

![](https://github.com/brodieG/fansi/raw/df4019e/extra/images/wrapped-2.png)

When we inject the 2-wide emoji into the 1-wide background their widths
are accounted for as shown by the result remaining rectangular:

    starts <- c(18, 13, 8, 13, 18)
    ends <-   c(23, 28, 33, 28, 23)
    substr2_ctl(wrapped, type='width', starts, ends) <- pizza.grin

![](https://github.com/brodieG/fansi/raw/v1.0-rc/extra/images/wrapped-1.png)

`fansi` width calculations use heuristics to account for graphemes,
including combining emoji:

    emo <- c(
      "\U1F468",
      "\U1F468\U1F3FD",
      "\U1F468\U1F3FD\u200D\U1F9B3",
      "\U1F468\u200D\U1F469\u200D\U1F467\u200D\U1F466"
    )
    writeLines(
      paste(
        emo,
        paste("base:", nchar(emo, type='width')),
        paste("fansi:", nchar_ctl(emo, type='width'))
    ) )
    ## 👨 base: 2 fansi: 2
    ## 👨🏽 base: 4 fansi: 2
    ## 👨🏽‍🦳 base: 6 fansi: 2
    ## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 base: 8 fansi: 2

## HTML Translation

You can translate ANSI CSI SGR formatted strings into their HTML
counterparts with `to_html`:

## Rmarkdown

It is possible to set `knitr` hooks such that R output that contains
ANSI CSI SGR is automatically converted to the HTML formatted equivalent
and displayed as intended. See the
[vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brodieG/fansi/rc/extra/sgr-in-rmd.html)
for details.

## Installation

This package is available on CRAN:

    install.packages('fansi')

It has no runtime dependencies.

For the development version use
`remotes::install_github('brodieg/fansi@development')` or:

    f.dl <- tempfile()
    f.uz <- tempfile()
    github.url <- 'https://github.com/brodieG/fansi/archive/development.zip'
    download.file(github.url, f.dl)
    unzip(f.dl, exdir=f.uz)
    install.packages(file.path(f.uz, 'fansi-development'), repos=NULL, type='source')
    unlink(c(f.dl, f.uz))

There is no guarantee that development versions are stable or even
working. The master branch typically mirrors CRAN and should be stable.
