\usage{
has_sgr(x, warn = getOption("fansi.warn", TRUE))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character vector or object that can be coerced to such.}

\item{warn}{TRUE (default) or FALSE, whether to warn when potentially
problematic \emph{Control Sequences} are encountered.  These could cause the
assumptions \code{fansi} makes about how strings are rendered on your display
to be incorrect, for example by moving the cursor (see \code{\link[=fansi]{?fansi}}).
At most one warning will be issued per element in each input vector.  Will
also warn about some badly encoded UTF-8 strings, but a lack of UTF-8
warnings is not a guarantee of correct encoding (use \code{\link{validUTF8}} for
that).}
}
\value{
logical of same length as \code{x}; NA values in \code{x} result in NA values
in return
}
\description{
This function is deprecated in favor of the \code{\link{has_ctl}}.  It
checks for CSI SGR and OSC hyperlink sequences.
